MechaHamster    {#mechahamster_readme}
======

[MechaHamster][] is a game about guiding a futuristic hamster ball through dangerous space mazes,
create mazes of their own, and share them with friends.  Can you guide Major Hammy D. Hamster to
safety?

## Motivation

[MechaHamster][] serves as a demonstration, sample, and reference for integrating
[Firebase][] with the [Firebase Unity SDK][], and [Daydream][] with the [Google VR SDK for Unity][]
into a game project.

## Overview

MechaHamster demonstrates the following concepts:

   * Mobile and [Daydream][] play modes.
   * [Firebase Analytics][] to measure various aspects of user behavior.
   * [Firebase Authentication][] to associate user generated content with users.
   * [Firebase Realtime Database][] to store map and user data in addition to sharing content.
   * [Firebase Cloud Messaging][] to allow game admins to send push notifications which inform users
     of new map content.
   * [Firebase Crashlytics (Beta)][] to capture crashes in game play and help
     developers diagnose and fix issues.
   * [Firebase Remote Config][] to allow game admins to run experiments on game data without
     redeploying a new build of the game.
   * [Firebase Cloud Storage][] to upload and download replay data of the best playthrough shared by
     the players in each level. (Disabled by default)
   * [Firebase Cloud Function][] to limit number of scores in Database and remove unreferenced
     replay data from Storage.
   * [Firebase Test Lab][] to allow developers to test their game across a wide variety of hardware
     and device configurations at once.
   * [Firebase CLI][] to allow developers to deploy configurations and Cloud Function to Firebase
     project through console commands.

## Downloading

[MechaHamster][] source code can be downloaded from [Github][].

> If cloning locally using `git clone`, be sure to use the `--recurse-submodules` flag
> to ensure required scripts from submodules are present.

And download the game to your mobile device from the AppStore and Google Play Store

## Building

   * Open the project in at least [Unity 5.6 beta][], this is required for the
     [Google VR SDK for Unity][].
   * Download the [Firebase Unity SDK][] and unzip.
   * Import the following plugins - using `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package` menu item -
     from the [Firebase Unity SDK][]:
      * FirebaseAnalytics.unitypackage
      * FirebaseAuth.unitypackage
      * FirebaseCrashlytics.unitypackage (Beta)
      * FirebaseDatabase.unitypackage
      * FirebaseMessaging.unitypackage
      * FirebaseRemoteConfig.unitypackage
      * FirebaseStorage.unitypackage
   * Select a target platform (iOS or Android) using the `File > Build Settings` menu option.
   * [Add Firebase to your app][]. For more information see [Building MechaHamster][].
   * Wait for the spinner (compiling) icon to stop in the bottom right corner of the Unity status
     bar.
   * Finally, select the `File > Build Settings` menu option then click `Build and Run`.

> [MechaHamster][] currently only works with .NET 3.x. If [Firebase Unity SDK][] version is 5.4.0 or
> above, please import plugins from `dotnet3` folder. And make sure `Scripting Runtime Version` in
> `Edit > Project Settings > Player` is set to .NET 3.x, ex. `Stable (.NET 3.5 Equivalent)` in Unity
> 2017
